## Create an interpreter with Go

Based on the book `Writing An Interpreter In Go`

### Goal:
Parse and evaluate our own language called Monkey by building an interpreter for it
Expressed as a list of features, Monkey has the following:
- C-like syntax
- variable bindings
- integers and booleans
- arithmetic expressions
- built-in functions
- first-class and higher-order functions
- closures
- a string data structure
- an array data structure
- a hash data structure
